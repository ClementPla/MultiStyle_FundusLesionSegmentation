This repository contains the code associated to the paper "Multi-style conversion for semantic segmentation of lesions in fundus images by adversarial attacks"

## Semantic Segmentation

We focus on the semantic segmentations of:
    1. Cotton Wool Spot
    2. Exudates
    3. Hemmorrhages
    4. Microaneurysms

For an easier use of the models, we refer to cleaned-up version of the code provided in the [fundus lesions toolkit](https://github.com/ClementPla/fundus-lesions-toolkit/tree/main/fundus_lesions_toolkit).

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```
