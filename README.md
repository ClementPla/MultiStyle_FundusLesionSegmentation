# Multi-style conversion for semantic segmentation of lesions in fundus images by adversarial attacks

This library offers a set of models (with pretrained weights) for the segmentation of lesions in fundus images.
As of now, four lesions are segmented:

    1. Cotton Wool Spot
    2. Exudates
    3. Hemmorrhages
    4. Microaneurysms

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```
